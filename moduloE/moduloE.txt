 >> Logical test at the beginning
  Logical testing > execute > loop(while is true)
  Follow a loop, if it is true, else go to the end.
  while (condition) {
    bloco
  }
If the while (enquanto) is true, will repeat, if else will go out to next.

function eatPizza() {
  while (haveSlice()) {
      eatSlice
  }
} 
//while you have Slice to eat, it will keep repeating until it finishes the pizza. When it eats all the Slices, the function will end automatically.
In the other example, it would only eat the slices described, but in the second function it would eat until it had slices regardless of the number of pizza slices.

>> Logical test at the end
Execute > logic testing > loop(while is true)
do {
  bloco (true or false)
} while (condition)
//while the condition is true, will do (fazer) the block in looping
