>> Simple variable can save just one value

>> Composite variable can save more values
Array is a vector in Portuguese, it is a compound variable, made up of elements, key and value of the content. The count always starts at zero.

let num = [5,8,4]
num = 5, 8, 4
num - 0, 1, 2 ... The spaces is declared with this.
So 5 is in the zero space, 8 in the 1 and 4 in the 2

num[3] = 6 // This means that the space 3 will receive the value 6
num.push(7) // This means that the space 4 will receive the value 7 in the last position.
num.length // this atribuite will counting the quantity of the elements I have. In this case the total is 5 and dont use () on js
num.sort() // it will organize the sequence, it will be 
num = 4 ,5, 6, 7, 8

console.log(num[0])
console.log(num[1])
console.log(num[2])
console.log(num[3])
console.log(num[4])
This the indexes is diffent

Vector display path // Percurtion to exibiton of the vector
for(let pos = 0; pos<num.length; pos++){
  console.log(num[pos])
} // The variable let is 0, which means it will initialize to 0 and the function will loop until the variable pos as long as the pos is smaller than num.lenght, that is, as long as it does not reach the end of the vector, which is its length, it will add one more.

for(let pos in num) { // for each position within the num (Composite variable)
  console.log(num[pos])
}

num = 4 ,5, 6, 7, 8
num.indexOf(7) // It will search the position this value is, so 7 is in the 3 position
num.indexOf(3) // As the value 3 has not position in the num variable, js will return -1, as for js it means that the value does not exist.
