Array is a vector in Portuguese, it is a compound variable, made up of elements, key and value of the content. The count always starts at zero.
let num = [5,8,4]
num = 5, 8, 4
num - 0, 1, 2 ... The spaces is declared with this.
So 5 is in the zero space, 8 in the 1 and 4 in the 2
num[3] = 6 // This means that the space 3 will receive the value 6
